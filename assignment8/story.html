      There is one thing every person has. He may not own a dog or an automobile or a wooden leg, 
      but he has a birthday of his own. 
      Even women have them; 
      they had them before they got the vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a country the size of this, with something like one hundred and ten million inhabitants and 
      only three hundred and sixty-six days in the biggest year now in use, three hundred thousand or 
      more people have birthdays every day. Figures like these astound the intelligence and make reason 
      totter on her throne. Just think! If each of the persons having a birthday to-day received but 
      one birthday card four inches in length, and those cards were placed end to end, they would make a row 
      of birthday cards one hundred thousand feet or more than nineteen miles long, and the cost, if figured 
      at only ten cents each, would be thirty thousand dollars. I wonder why I never went into the birthday-card business!
    </p>
    <p>
      My own birthday, the one I keep for my private use, comes on the fifth day of December, rain or shine, 
      even when that day falls on Sunday. I have had it since 1869, and it is getting thin in spots and is not 
      as fresh and crisp as it was. It is beginning to look like a dollar bill that has been in circulation since 
      Grant was [Pg 5]President; but even at that I get a certain amount of cheer out of it, as I shall explain later.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a time when my birthday was a mighty important event. For twelve months you might wake me up any night 
      and ask me how old I was and I would say, ‘Eight, going on nine,’ and the moment I opened my eyes on December 5th 
      I was ‘nine, going on ten,’ and the most important job I had was to look forward to the next birthday, when I would be 
      ‘ten, going on eleven.’
    </p>
    <p>
      But I’ve got over that. I’m not so crazy about birthdays any more. I don’t worry about whether or not 
      they are going to come; I have a feeling that they are going to come along right regularly, whether I 
      fret about them or not. And I don’t spend much time saying to myself, [Pg 6]‘I’m ninety-nine, going on a 
      hundred,’ or whatever my age may be. I’m not interested. If anybody asks me, suddenly, how old I am, I have 
      to subtract 1869 from 1925, and I’m likely to miss the correct answer by ten or twenty years. And that does not bother me, either.
     </p>
    <p>
      December has always been a favorite birthday month in our family. My birthday arrives a few days after 
      I have the last tulip bulbs in the ground, and my father’s is six days later, and my boy’s dog’s birthday 
      is two days after that. The dog does not get many letters concerning [Pg 7]his birthday, but I do—I get quite 
      a number, and a good many are from people I don’t know at all. That is because some newspaper syndicate has 
      included me in a daily feature entitled something like ‘Who Was Born To-day.’ I suppose the people who read 
      those birthday dates think it is not much use writing to Adam or Moses or the man who invented suspenders, 
      they being too considerably elsewhere, so they write to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, every year, I get quite a few birthday letters from these unknown friends. 
      And I like to get them, too. But I do think there is just a little too much suggestion 
      in some of them of an idea [Pg 8]that means, ‘Well, you poor old fish, here’s another 
      of your years gone—you’ll be through before long!’
    </p>
    <p>
      I don’t like that; I don’t vote that ticket. Being a good-natured man—except in the bosom of my family—I have to write a 
      line or two to those people and say, ‘Thanks for your kind birthday wishes, you have touched my heart’; 
      but what I would like to write is, ‘Go on! You’ll probably be dead twenty years before I am; go weep on your own shoulder.’ 
      I can’t concede that I’m crazy to be the sort of man who looks up from his tulip-planting and gazes at his neighbor 
      and draws a long face and sighs, and says, ‘Yes, yes! I’m a year older to-day—before long they’ll put me in the box 
      with the silver handles and plant me a little deeper than the tulip bulbs.’
    </p>

      Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive
      classification, if only an easy outline one for the present, hereafter to
      be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers. As no better man
      advances to take this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor
      endeavors. I promise nothing complete; because any human thing supposed to
      be complete, must for that very reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not
      pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species, or&mdash;in
      this place at least&mdash;to much of any description. My object here is
      simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology. I am the
      architect, not the builder.

      When I was a boy out in Iowa, I had a friend who had a grandaunt 
      named Petunia Mullins, and every time her birthday came around he 
      coaxed me to go with him when he took a present to her. He hated to 
      go alone, and I did not blame him. He would climb the stairs to her 
      flat and hesitate at the door and then tap on it reluctantly, and when 
      she opened to him he would screw his face into a bright, sunny smile 
      and hand her the nice hand-embroidered teapot or silver-plated handkerchief, 
      and cry merrily, ‘Happy birthday, Aunt Petunia!’ And when she had taken the 
      present and had looked for the tag to see how much it had cost, she would roll 
      up her eyes and snuffle and say, ‘Yes, yes! it is the sad day; I won’t be with
      you much longer, William.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Up the river from us a few miles another of the boys had an uncle. 
      I’ll call him ‘Uncle Pethcod,’ because Pethcod is a name I don’t care 
      much for, and I never cared much for this man. I rowed up there in a 
      skiff with this Uncle Pethcod’s nephew on one of his birthdays. It was 
      a beautiful day—a bright sunny day—and Sam handed his uncle a classy 
      wall calendar all wrapped up in tissue paper and tied with a blue ribbon. 
      The calendar was a lovely thing, with a Gibson girl on it in eight colors, 
      and just as good as when Sam received it for Christmas, [Pg 11]except that 
      it was a little smudged in one place where Sam had rubbed out the ‘25 cts.’ 
      and put ‘$1.50’ in place of it. It was a calendar any one should have been glad to own, 
      and it should have given that uncle a thrill of happiness; but when he had pulled off its 
      wrappings he looked at it sadly and shook his head. ‘Thank you, Samuel, thank you,’ he said. 
      ‘I always loved calendars, but I don’t expect I’ll get full use out of this one. I shouldn’t 
      wonder if I would be naught but a cold blue corpse laid underground before all the days on this calendar have passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow that seemed to cast an unnecessary gloom over an otherwise perfectly good occasion.
       And the worst of it was that the old man was [Pg 12]wrong, entirely wrong, because it was a last 
       year’s calendar and the days on it had already passed. He might as well have been cheerful about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes I think we make too much of this birthday business in this country, 
      or go at it the wrong way, or something. We look on our birthdays as if our years 
      were a pile of twenty-dollar bills and the birthday was the day we spent the last 
      cent of one and broke the next into small change. I can’t see a birthday in that 
      light at all; I don’t become a year older on my birthday; the longest birthday I 
      ever live [Pg 13]can’t make me more than twenty-four hours older than I was the day before, 
      and that’s nothing to get excited about. Every day does that to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you look at this thing properly, a birthday is no more important than any one of 
      the million ticks of a clock as the hands proceed at a regular pace around the dial. 
      When the hands point to twelve the clock strikes twelve—or, if it is like some clocks 
      I’ve owned, it strikes eleven or twenty-two or sixteen—but that doesn’t mean an hour 
      has jumped past at that moment. The clock doesn’t go over in a musty corner and sob, 
      ‘Here’s another twelve hours gone—in a few more hours I’ll be junk!’ You bet it doesn’t! 
      It knows better. Nothing has happened, [Pg 14]except that another second has gone by in 
      exactly the usual way. That’s nothing to make a man blue—or a woman either.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know a man who is so pessimistic that if you make him a present of a brand-new 
      silver dollar he will turn it over and over trying to see if he can’t discover 
      that one side of that dollar is darker than the other side of it. A silver dollar, 
      spang-new from the mint, has no dark side, but that doesn’t bother this fellow—if 
      that dollar has no dark side he picks out one side and calls it the dark side, and 
      that’s the only side of that dollar you can ever get him to look at.

      A couple of years ago we had a long and cold and hard winter and there was a lot 
      of snow. I was going downtown the first warm day that spring, [Pg 15]and the snow had 
      melted considerably, and I met this dark-side fellow at his gate. Where the snow had 
      melted in his yard the grass was rich and green, and where the sun was strongest a dandelion had opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well,’ I said, ‘there’s a dandelion! That looks good; that looks as if spring was here at last.’
    </p>
    <p>
      The dark-side citizen looked at the dandelion and all the joy of living went out of him in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, yes!’ he said. ‘That’s the way it goes; it will be winter again before we know it!’
    </p>
    <p>
      That man would never in this world think of his birthday as a joyous [Pg 16]
      celebration of the fact that he was lucky to be born. I never asked him, but 
      I’ll bet he considers his birthdays nothing but advance warnings of his approaching death. 
      And that’s a fine way to celebrate!
    </p>
    <p>
      When I lived out in Iowa as a boy, I knew a charming old lady who gave 
      herself a small birthday party every year. She always had a little dinner 
      party on that day and invited a few of her dearest friends, and as my aunt 
      was one of those friends and I was living with my aunt I was invited too. 
      To me, dear Mrs. Van’s birthday parties were always a great event. I always 
      looked forward to them eagerly and was glad [Pg 17]she had been born, and 
      one reason was that always, as we left after dinner, Mrs. Van gave each of 
      us a little parcel of some sort, and in it was a birthday present.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot now remember what most of the presents she gave me were; I only remember 
      that one of them was a majolica saucer, shaped and colored like a pale green lettuce 
      leaf, and it must have cost all of ten cents. I kept that saucer for years, and it 
      was one of the things I was fondest of, just as a boy is always fond of a thing he 
      has no use for and that is especially inappropriate for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That majolica saucer, presented to me on her birthday by that cultured elderly lady, 
      probably said to me, ‘You see! Mrs. Van knows you are not a mere clodhopper; 
      she knows you appreciate Art. Other folks may [Pg 18]think you can’t appreciate 
      anything but brown molasses taffy and dead cats and buckwheat cakes and useful 
      things of that sort, but Mrs. Van knows you can treasure finer and better things, 
      such as genuine majolica lettuce leaves.’
    </p>
    <p>
      We can’t tell what effect such seemingly trivial things have on our lives. 
      Possibly owning that majolica saucer stirred my young heart with a desire to 
      have a home of my own that I could put majolica saucers in, thus leading me 
      to want to have a wife, and twins, and other children, and gas bills, and be 
      a respected citizen with taxes to pay. If it [Pg 19]had not been for that majolica 
      saucer I might have grown up with no thought of home. I might have rushed away in
       some fit of bitter anger at the woodpile, and have become a lone wolf and ended 
       by being a Mexican bandit. I might have become an outcast, wearing a belt to keep 
       my pants up, instead of wearing one because suspenders are not fashionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has always seemed to me that Mrs. Van’s custom of giving presents on her birthday indicated 
      that she considered her birthday a day on which to remember that it was good to have been born 
      and to be alive. She was glad she had been born, and she wanted others to be glad, so she gave 
      them presents. You would imagine, when you see how some people hate [Pg 20]the coming of their
       birthdays, that there was some law of nature that declared that a man must inevitably die on 
       the same day of the year as that on which he was born—that his birthday was also his deathday. 
       If that were so, I might have some reason to hang up a bunch of crape and write for prices on coffins, 
       plain and fancy, as my birthday approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any of you want to think of your birthdays as a sort of subpœna to prepare to meet your doom, 
      go ahead and do so—I don’t want to. I don’t even want to think of my birthday as a hint that another year is gone. 
      I want my birthday celebrated by me as the one strictly personal festival I have on the calendar.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m willing to put on a clean shirt and go out and whoop it up on Washington’s Birthday, 
      and I’m willing to join in with the rest of the boys and hurrah on Lincoln’s Birthday, 
      but Washington and Lincoln are neither of them half as important to me as I am to myself, 
      and when my birthday comes I want to get a little fun out of it, <a href="story2.html">even if no one else does.</a>
