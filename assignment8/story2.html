        I don’t want to think of it as a mere memorandum that three hundred and sixty-five days have 
        passed away during the last fifty-two weeks of time. I wouldn’t call that much of a birthday. 
        If that was all I wanted [Pg 22]a birthday for, I could use any other day just as well. I can 
        look sober and say, ‘Well, another year is gone,’ on December 16th or June 10th or on the Fourth 
        of July or October 3d or any other day. A ‘year’ ends every day of the year; a ‘year’ ends at every 
        tick of the clock, doesn’t it?
    </p>

        One of the saddest cases on record is that of Emmett C. Stocks, late of Cebada, Iowa. Emmett was born at Cebada, 
        and he had a sister Aurelia who was born in the same place; but when she was twenty-four she married a man named 
        Finch and moved to Oregon. Emmett was three years younger than Aurelia—or so he supposed—and he lived with his Uncle 
        Peter Stocks and worked in his notion store. He got five dollars per [Pg 23]week at first and paid his Uncle Peter 
        three dollars per week board, but when Emmett reached his twenty-first birthday his Uncle Peter did what he had always 
        promised to do and raised Emmett’s pay to ten dollars per week.
    </p>

    <p>
        Things went along this way for a few years and then Emmett’s Uncle Peter died and the notion 
        store gave up its ghost, and Emmett went to work in the Farmers’ and Merchants’ Bank in Cebada, 
        and he was so well fitted to the banking business that in ten years he was president of the bank, 
        owned nine tenths of the stock, and possessed thirty thousand dollars’ worth of mortgages on the outside.
    </p>

    <p>
        A year after having been made president of the bank, Emmett married [Pg 24]Ruth Filsom, 
        whose father owned the Cebada Dairy, and in due time they had four fine children—two boys 
        and two girls—and Emmett built a swell house on the lot cater-cornered from the Methodist Church.
    </p>

    <p>
        The man who told me about Emmett said that all his life Emmett was the happiest and most contented 
        man ever known in Cebada. He used to go around town humming a little tune and chewing a couple of cardamom seeds, 
        picking up first and second mortgages that he found lying around loose, and people often spoke of him, and said 
        that if ever there was a man who looked happy and was happy, Emmett Stocks was that man.
    </p>

    <p>
        Things went on like this until Emmett was sixty-nine years old. On his sixty-ninth birthday 
        he gave a party and invited all his friends, and his wife built a dandy birthday cake for the 
        occasion with sixty-nine little red candles on it and ‘E. S.’ traced out in red peppermints on the icing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just before he cut the cake, Emmett made a little speech. He thanked those present for the 
        gifts they had brought and said his finest feelings had been touched by the love and affection 
        shown him, and that they would have to pardon him if his voice trembled, because when he thought 
        how greatly blessed he had been he was close to tears. He had [Pg 26]to stop for a moment right 
        there to control himself; but he went on and said he had the dearest wife and the best children, 
        and that the Farmers’ and Merchants’ Bank was in fine financial condition and paying thirty-two per 
        cent annually and he had nothing to kick about and a lot to be glad for. Then he said he was now sixty-nine 
        years old, but he did not feel it.
    </p>

    <p>
        He said he knew that seventy years was the time allotted to man on this earth by the Psalmist, and he would not kick about that—he had had sixty-nine perfect years; and if the Psalmist’s rule came true in his case he would still have one glorious year ahead of him, and he would [Pg 27]be satisfied and happy and content. He said he knew he would live until he was seventy, because he felt like a boy and his liver was in good condition and he had never had any stomach trouble to speak of
    </p>

    <p>
        He was going on to say that he here and now invited one and all to come to his birthday party a year from then, when Obed Riggs, the assistant postmaster of Cebada, pushed into the room. He was panting a little, because he had run all the way from the post-office. The evening mail had arrived and among it was a package for Emmett, all the way from Oregon, and Obed guessed rightly that it was a birthday present from Emmett’s sister Aurelia, and he had hurried to put it in Emmett’s hands.
    </p>

    <p>
        When he saw Aurelia’s name and address in the corner of the package Emmett smiled a happy smile and asked permission to open the package before he went on with his speech because, he said, this was the crowning happiness of the occasion—a gift from his beloved sister Aurelia. So he took the knife with which he had been going to cut the cake, and cut the cord that bound the package.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        ‘It’s a book,’ he said. ‘Aurelia knows I like books.’
    </p>

    <p>
        Then he removed the paper wrapper and looked at the book, and more tears filled his eyes, because he knew in an instant what the book was. It was the old Stocks Family Bible. He opened the book and the volume [Pg 29]parted at the place between the Old and New Testaments where the closely written pages of ‘Family Records’ began with a page of ‘Births.’
    </p>

    <p>
        Emmett ran his eyes down this page, and then he came to the record of his own birth, and the smile that had been on his face slowly faded out. In its place came a look of horror and despair. There could be no doubt about it, he had to believe his own eyes—he was not sixty-nine years old, he was seventy.
    </p>

    <p>
        From that moment Emmett Stocks was a changed man. He closed the Bible and looked around the room with a woe-begone countenance, and after a moment he turned and went out and climbed the stairs to his bedroom, [Pg 30]and undressed and got into bed. For six days he lay there speechless, with the tears streaming down his face, and on the seventh day he died.
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course, there was all sorts of talk about this in Cebada. Some of the meaner folks, those who owed Emmett money, said the reason he sickened and died was because he remembered that his Uncle Peter had promised to give Emmett that five-dollar raise on Emmett’s twenty-first birthday and, because Emmett was mistaken in his birthday, the increased pay had not begun until Emmett was twenty-two, and that thus Emmett had lost five dollars a week for a solid fifty-two weeks, back [Pg 31]in 1864, and that the thought had been too much for him. But that was not the real reason. The real reason was that Emmett Stocks had become so used to feeling as old as his birthdays told him he ought to feel, that the sudden shock of learning that he was a year older than he had figured simply killed him. Since I heard about Emmett Stocks, I’ve quit using my birthdays to tell time by. It’s not safe.

        When I was in Paris I attended a birthday party there. It was strictly a family affair; but the young man who was celebrating was the son of the lady who owned the _pension_ where I was staying, and as I had paid part of my board bill that week I was considered one [Pg 32]of the family. I can’t say the affair was very riotous. Members of the family from near and far sat around the edge of the room on stiff-backed chairs and nibbled small cakes and sipped thin wine, and conversed gently in a sedate manner. I did not do much conversation myself, the only French I knew at that time being ‘low show,’ which means ‘hot water,’ and somehow that did not seem to work into the conversation advantageously. No matter how good a man’s intentions are, or how willing he may be to make an affair a success, he is apt to be misunderstood if he breaks into the middle of a family talk, uttering ‘hot water’ in a loud voice.
    </p>

    <p>
        In some ways that birthday party in Paris seemed more like a highly respectable funeral than we think birthday parties should seem; but one had only to look at the young man who was the leading gentleman in the affair to know it was not a funeral. He grinned more than the corpse usually does, and seemed to be a lot more uncomfortable, but he certainly enjoyed it all and was proud to be celebrated that way. As a usual thing, I try to take a prominent part in affairs and to be the life of the party, telling amusing jokes about Pat and Mike; but this time I merely sat around and looked intelligent until the affair was over, and then I came out strong. When every one present kissed the [Pg 34]young man on both cheeks I refrained from kissing him and shook his hand instead, and this gave the party a sort of international aspect and made it a great success.
    </p>

    <p>
        But what I like best about the French annual doings is that when a man celebrates his birthday there he calls it his ‘fête-day,’ which means a feast-day or festival-day. And usually it is not his birthday at all; it is the day in the calendar consecrated to the particular saint whose name he bears, if any. That certainly takes a lot of sting out of birthdays and makes them more joyous and care-free, just as if I had been named Independence Butler and had a right to celebrate myself on [Pg 35]the Fourth of July. A ‘fête-day’ suggests something to celebrate with some sort of hurrah, a person’s own Christmas or Thanksgiving, as if everybody ought to be glad I was born. ‘Birthday’ is too apt to suggest nothing but that the clock has ticked again, that another coupon has been torn from my seventy-trip book, that another hole has been punched in my meal-ticket.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’ll bet you never saw a magazine come out on its fiftieth anniversary with a black mourning border around the front cover and an editorial saying, ‘Alas! This magazine is fifty years old now, and just that much nearer death!’ No, sir! It prints the picture of a lovely young girl on [Pg 36]the cover, and the editorial says, ‘Hurrah, boys! We’re fifty years old and going strong and we’ll probably live forever.’
    </p>

    <p>
        The idea that every birthday shortens your life is all nonsense. The truth is that every birthday is a guarantee that you will live longer than you ever had any right to think you would. Every birthday you reach puts your probable deathday further into the future.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I was twenty-one I went to a young doctor to be examined for life insurance purposes, and when he had pawed me all over and listened to my interior clock-work he drew a mighty long face.
    </p>

    <p>
        ‘I’ll pass you,’ he said, ‘but I should not do it. You have a heart. [Pg 37]You may go along until you are about forty, and then your heart will begin to kick up and you won’t be able to do any more work, and a couple of years later you’ll be walking along the street some day, and you’ll stop short with an expression of surprise and immediately enter the pearly gates.’
    </p>

    <p>
        Twenty years ago I was examined for insurance again. The doctor this time was no friend of mine, and I had never seen him before. He pawed over me and stuck new and improved appliances against me fore and aft—megaphones and dictaphones and so on. When he was through he asked me if I had had a good night’s rest the night before. I told [Pg 38]him the truth. I said I had had a regular Hades of a time. I said my baby daughter was teething and I had walked the floor with her three quarters of the night and she yelling bloody murder. Then I asked him if he asked because there was anything serious the matter with me, and he said there was not. He said the heart action showed I had not rested well at night lately, but it was nothing important.
    </p>

    <p>
        A few days ago I was examined again, and once more for life insurance, and again I did not know the doctor from Adam. In the twenty years that had passed, a whole new lot of testing appliances have been invented, and by the time the doctor had them all clamped on me I looked like [Pg 39]a three hundred dollar car decorated with five hundred dollars’ worth of accessories. When the doctor had walked around me a couple of dozen times, studying the dials and reading the indexes, he gave his opinion—I was as sound as a nut: heart all right, blood pressure all right, lungs all right, everything all right. Not a thing the matter with me. So I’m younger than when I was twenty-one. When I was twenty-one I was sure to be dead at forty-four; now I’m fifty-five and if my great-grandchildren ever want to get rid of me they will probably have to use an axe on me sometime along about 1974.
    </p>

    <p>
        The insurance companies, to whom such things mean success or failure, [Pg 40]have been collecting statistics and compiling tables for many long years, and they base their business on those charts and tables. All those charts prove that, at least until you are ninety-five years old, you should celebrate every birthday with joy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Suppose, for a moment, you were born in 1855. Dr. Louis I. Dublin, a New York insurance statistician, says that the first ‘Expectation of Life’ table of any value, in the United States, was compiled in Massachusetts in 1855. This set the expectation of life at forty years. In other words, the average baby born in 1855 had a right to expect to live to be forty. In 1910 the figure had increased to fifty-one years.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1920 it was over fifty-five years, and Dr. Dublin believed that campaigns to reduce the worst diseases, together with improved sanitary conditions and better standards of living, might add ten years to that. In 1924, in his report to Congress, Surgeon-General Cumming, of the Public Health Service, said fifty-six years was now the average span of life in America, and contrasted it with the sixteenth century when the average life was between eighteen and twenty years. So, you see, every time you celebrate your birthday you can also celebrate the improved sanitary conditions and new conquests of disease that mean you should live longer than you thought you would when you celebrated your birthday <a href="story3.html">a year ago.</a>
